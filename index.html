      <h2 class="card-title">Acting</h2>
      <p class="card-description">I have had a passion for television and acting for as long as I can remember. I
        studied theater in college and for a long period of time persued an acting career in Los Angeles. As it always
        goes, there were many up and downs along this career path, but I am glad I chose to follow my heart and try to
        make it happen.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Fitness</h2>
      <p class="card-description">I was a certified personal trainer in Los Angeles for many years. I did this to
        supplement my income while I pursued my acting career. I have always been a health and fitness fanatic and to
        this day am very active in the gym.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Friends</h2>
      <p class="card-description">Friends are your choosen family and I love them all dearly. With my journeys across
        the world, I have been able to meet wonderful people that have become true friends. I always look to my friends
        to bring me up when I am down, and to provide the support I need during this career transition.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Travel</h2>
      <p class="card-description">My numebr one favorite thing to do in this world is to travel and create memories with
        friends and family outside of our own normal lives. I try to travel at least two to three times a year to
        international destinations to visit friends and make new ones. Travel keeps me sane and invigorates me. I am
        always excited for my next adventure, which I know is just around the corner.</p>
